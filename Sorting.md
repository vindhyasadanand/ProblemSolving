<h4> What is Sorting?</h4>
<p>Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or Collection in increasing or decreasing Order of Some Property </P></br>
<h4>Classification of Sorting Algorithms Based Upon,</h4>
<ol>
  <li>  Time Complexity : It is Rate of Growth of time taken by An Algorithm with respect to input size</li>
  <li> Space Complexity (Memory Usage) - Some Algorithms will not need additional memory and they are called as <b>In-Place</b>Algorithms
  </li>
  <li> Stability </li>
 </ol>
