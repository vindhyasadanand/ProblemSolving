<h1> Sorting Algorithms </h1>
<h4> What is Sorting?</h4>
<p>Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or Collection in increasing or decreasing Order of Some Property </P></br>
<h4>Classification of Sorting Algorithms Based Upon,</h4>
<ol>
  <li> <b> Time Complexity </b>: It is Rate of Growth of time taken by An Algorithm with respect to input size</li>
  <li><b> Space Complexity (Memory Usage)</b> - Some Algorithms will not need additional memory and they are called as <b>In-Place</b> Algorithms
  </li>
  <li> <b>Stability</b> : Stable sorting Algorithms  </li>
 </ol>
