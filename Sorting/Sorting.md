<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<h4> What is Sorting?</h4>
<p>Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or Collection in increasing or decreasing Order of Some Property </P></br>
<h4>Classification of Sorting Algorithms Based Upon,</h4>
<ol>
  <li> <b> Time Complexity </b>: It is Rate of Growth of time taken by An Algorithm with respect to input size</li>
  <li><b> Space Complexity (Memory Usage)</b> - Some Algorithms will not need additional memory and they are called as <b>In-Place</b> Algorithms
  </li>
  <li> <b>Stability</b> : Stable sorting Algorithms Preserves the Relative Order of elements  </li>
  <li><b>Internal sort</b> vs <b>External Sort</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>When records that are need to be sorted are in the main memory or RAM then it is <b>Internal Sort</b></li>
    <li>When records that are need to be sorted are in auxiliary storage like disk,tapes such a sort is called <b>External Sort</b></li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Recursive</b> or<b> Non Recursive</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Merge Sort , Quick Sort are examples for <b>Recursive Algorithms</b> </li>
    <li> Insertion Sort , Selection Sort are examples for <b>Non Recursive Algorithms</b>
  </ul>
  </li>
 </ol>
